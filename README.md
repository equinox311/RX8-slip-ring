This is a 3D printed slip ring for use in place of a clock spring for use with an NRG Short Hub on a Mazda RX-8. This allows an aftermarket wheel's horn button to work without using tradiational janky methods of putting bobby pins and hairclips behind the wheel.

# Installation
1. Remove the factory clock spring, this should probably already be done.
2. Take Brass_Ring_Guide.STL and put epoxy on the mating surface of Brass_Ring.STL
3. Place Brass_Ring.STL inside the guides, it should be a bit tight and let the epoxy cure
4. Solder some wire to the back of the brass ring, make sure to offset it from where the bottom spring will contact
5. Install Mazda_Slip_Ring.STL in the same location as the old clock spring.
6. Put some general purpose grease around the spring locators and inside and outside of the races
7. Install the springs
8. Install Brass_Ring_Guide.STL by aligning the holes of the ring with the springs, some light sanding may be needed depending on the tolorences of the brass ring. Brass_Ring_Guide.STL should be able to slide in and out of the race with ease
9. Use a small coating of dielectric grease on the contact surface of Brass_Ring.STL to the NRG Short Hub
10. Install the NRG Short Hub
11. Connect the wire to the 12v supply for the horn
12. Install your aftermarket steering wheel and go BEEP, BEEP!
